# ADDING Ideas:
IDEA 1
Traffic situational awareness app 
using Semi Blockchain technology
Description:-I t will be an app which will enable users 
to see through corners while driving in accident 
hotspots. It will also tell the likelihood of getting 
bumped to another car while driving(both cars need 
to use this application).

Skills needed:
Android development
basic knowledge of cryptography
Networking
Python(Google map API,Socket programming,API to simulate 2D kinematics)

Features:
It'll reduce unfortunate accidents in Highway intersections.
It'll help to create fast passages for emergency vehicles like fire brigade , Police,ambulances,VIP and miltary convoys also.
It'll encourage slow driving (which is safe).
It'll enable general public to use thei computers and phones to earn from traffic(Like crypto  mining).
It'll also correct mistakes of the driver while driving .(EX-Like speeding up near schools temples)
It'll provide statistics on road conditions in different areas.(Data collected by sensors deployed in public transport vehicles).



It will use semi-block chain because conventional blockchain will be too sloew for this purpose.
General public will be aloowed to join the network...They'll have to serve public by using their computation power .




Architecture:
It'll have n number of central servers to authenticate users and verify ledger data(to be explained later).
Client's device will be connected to two ledger(public) the ledger has to process some mathematical calculations and then it sends outputs to central server . 
The cental server verifies data and sends it to client's device.

Business:
Google ADs(Location based promotions of local shops, malls etc) one can avoid ADs by driving slow.

IDEA 2(Utilising IDEA 1 with some added facilities)
As we are using consortium(public-private) blockchain so, when any of the vehicles get into any wholes then the vehicles nearby including us(main controller) will get notified about the wholes. Then, we can inform the state CPWD to take some immediate action. And if they are unable to take any action, then we can use our blockchain technology and track the vehicle users(those who usually used to cross the particular road containing wholes very often) and send them a message through our app that to write a complain letter to that particular website pressurizing about the situation of road and to take immediate action. Then again if the state CPWD failed to repair all those or if they replied to our complains that the CENTRAL GOVT. is not providing much funds for repairing purpose then we should suggest for the PRIORITY BASIS that the doctors/govt. officials/other VIP person and suggest the CPWD and traffic department to introduce a BLUE light in the TRAFFIC light (Only for AMBULANCE and GOVT. OF INDIA/ODISHA cars). Using this we can do one thing that, if a road is unsafe (the road is a way to a hospital/Parliament) then at 10-15 kms away from that road when the VIP vehicles will pass through a traffic then the BLUE light will glow indicating as a WARNING; this will notify us also and then we can search for the new way and we will send a message to the common users of the new way road and we can notify/inform the VIP vehicles about the conditions of the road of their new way or we can advise them to use a particular way to their destination.

IDEA 3:(The Social Media App)
Using blockchain or any other suitable technology, We will aim to develop a social media app. Social media apps are all about likes and followers, but in our app the people will be anonymous. No user knows the other user. People have to type their little secrets or "stories" and which ever story gets max likes will get a place at trending story tab. This in turn encouages the end person to write better and this has way less toxicity due to lack of fake filters and fake lifestyles. People ofcourse need something to be attracted with, so the "trending tab": top 3 people will get money in form of amazon coupons or any other way. The app is absolutely free and solely relies on ad revenue. It is aimed at privacy which is laking in todays world & people will always remian unknown, Hence sharing of person secrets, confessions or mental problems and getting solutions by others by "Comment" feature can really help intoverts getting social. This is a new way of sharing secrets without no one knowing who you actually are.
